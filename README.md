**Android mobile app for recording music loops**
# 
### What is it?
Sound loop â€” is an audio fragment that records once and then repeats in a cycle.
There is a music device called Looper that can make sound loops. This app is a simulation of that device.
### How it works?
You can record up to 6 loop threads in a music track. You need just to click on a free record button to start.
After your record is ready, click again to stop recording. The recorded loop will start playing automatically.
- __You can record only 1 loop in a time;__
- __Works only on physical devices (you need to have a mic to record loops).__

### Preparation
Before you start the recording you need to set up built-in metronome. You need to set measure value and BPM. Every action with your loop will syncronize with your beat.

### How to save (Under development)
This part of app is not yet implemented. In future you can save your tracks on a physical device or send it via email. After that you can list your records and listen to them.

### Development
This app is still under development so it can work not properly. To contribute make pull requeust and contact us on a github.

### In Future
After the basic app is done we will make a PRO version that will include:
- More available loops;
- Scheduling engine that will give an opportunity to schedule all the actions with loops before you start record.
